## üîß Usage Examples

### Example 1: Payment Processing Schema

```
Act as a senior database architect specializing in fintech applications. Design a comprehensive database schema with the following specifications:

**Application Context:**
- Application Name: PayFlow Payment Processing Platform
- Database Type: PostgreSQL 14+
- Expected Scale: 1M users, 10M transactions/month
- Compliance Requirements: PCI DSS Level 1, SOX, GDPR
- Geographic Distribution: Multi-region (US, EU)

**Business Requirements:**
- Core Entities: Users, Payment Methods, Transactions, Payments, Refunds, Disputes
- Data Relationships: User has multiple payment methods, payments link to transactions
- Business Rules: Minimum $0.50 payments, maximum $50,000 per transaction
- Audit Requirements: Complete audit trail for all financial operations
- Retention Policies: Transaction data 7 years, audit logs 10 years

**Technical Requirements:**
- Performance Targets: <100ms for payment lookups, 1000 TPS capacity
- Concurrency: 10,000 concurrent users during peak hours
- Data Volume: 100GB initial, growing 20GB/month
- Backup/Recovery: RPO 15 minutes, RTO 1 hour
- Encryption: AES-256 for PII, tokenization for payment data

**Compliance and Security:**
- PII Handling: GDPR right to erasure, data minimization
- Financial Data: PCI DSS compliant storage, no raw card data
- Regulatory Reporting: Real-time fraud detection, AML screening
- Data Classification: Public, Internal, Confidential, Restricted levels
```

### Example 2: Lending Platform Schema

```
**Application Context:**
- Application Name: LendTech Personal Loan Platform
- Database Type: PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB for time-series data
- Expected Scale: 500K users, 100K loan applications/month
- Compliance Requirements: Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA)
- Geographic Distribution: US-only with state-specific regulations

**Business Requirements:**
- Core Entities: Borrowers, Loan Applications, Credit Reports, Loans, Payments, Collections
- Data Relationships: Complex scoring models, payment histories, risk assessments
- Business Rules: $1,000-$50,000 loan amounts, 12-60 month terms, credit score minimums
- Audit Requirements: Decision audit trails, model versioning, regulatory reporting
- Retention Policies: Application data 5 years, credit decisions permanent archive
```

## ‚úÖ Expected Output Components

When using this template, AI should generate:

1. **Complete DDL Scripts** with all table definitions
2. **Security Configuration** with encryption and access controls
3. **Performance Indexes** optimized for query patterns
4. **Constraint Definitions** enforcing business rules
5. **Audit Logging Setup** for compliance requirements
6. **Migration Scripts** for version management
7. **Sample Data Scripts** for development and testing
8. **Monitoring Scripts** for performance tracking
9. **Backup/Recovery Procedures** with automation
10. **Documentation** with ERD and data dictionary

## üîí Security Best Practices

### Data Protection:
- **Encryption at Rest**: AES-256 for sensitive columns
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all connections
- **Tokenization**: Replace sensitive data with non-sensitive tokens
- **Hashing**: Irreversible hashing for passwords and secrets
- **Key Management**: Secure key rotation and storage

### Access Control:
- **Role-Based Access**: Principle of least privilege
- **Row-Level Security**: User can only access own data
- **Column-Level Security**: Restrict access to sensitive fields
- **API Security**: Rate limiting and input validation
- **Audit Logging**: Track all data access and modifications

## üìä Performance Optimization

### Indexing Strategy:
- **Primary Keys**: Clustered indexes on UUID/BIGINT
- **Foreign Keys**: Indexes on all foreign key columns
- **Query Patterns**: Indexes optimized for common queries
- **Composite Indexes**: Multi-column indexes for complex queries
- **Partial Indexes**: Conditional indexes for filtered queries

### Partitioning:
- **Range Partitioning**: By date for time-series data
- **Hash Partitioning**: For even data distribution
- **List Partitioning**: By category or status
- **Partition Pruning**: Optimize queries with partition elimination

### Query Optimization:
- **Query Plans**: Analyze and optimize execution plans
- **Statistics**: Keep table statistics current
- **Connection Pooling**: Optimize connection management
- **Caching**: Strategic use of materialized views and cache layers

## üîÑ Migration and Versioning

### Schema Evolution:
1. **Backward Compatible Changes**: Add columns with defaults
2. **Breaking Changes**: Multi-step migration process
3. **Data Migrations**: Safe data transformation procedures
4. **Rollback Plans**: Always have rollback procedures ready
5. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing on production-like data

### Version Control:
- **Migration Scripts**: Sequential, numbered migration files
- **Environment Consistency**: Ensure all environments match
- **Documentation**: Document all schema changes
- **Change Reviews**: Peer review for all schema modifications
