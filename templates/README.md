- Specify output format preferences

## 🚀 Best Practices for AI Prompting

### Be Specific and Clear
```
❌ "Create a payment system"
✅ "Create a Node.js payment processing service that handles credit card transactions, includes fraud detection, complies with PCI DSS standards, and integrates with Stripe API"
```

### Provide Context
```
✅ "For a fintech application serving 10,000+ daily users, create a scalable authentication system that supports OAuth 2.0, JWT tokens, and multi-factor authentication"
```

### Specify Output Format
```
✅ "Generate TypeScript code with:
- Interface definitions
- Error handling
- Unit tests
- JSDoc comments
- Following clean code principles"
```

### Request Examples and Edge Cases
```
✅ "Include examples for:
- Successful payment processing
- Card declined scenarios
- Network timeout handling
- Invalid input validation"
```
