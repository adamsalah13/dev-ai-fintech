## ‚úÖ Expected Output Components

When using this template, AI should generate:

1. **Complete Pipeline Configuration** (YAML/JSON)
2. **Dockerfile** with security best practices
3. **Build Scripts** for automation
4. **Test Automation Scripts** for all test types

## üéØ Validation Checklist

Before deploying the pipeline:

- [ ] All security scans are configured and passing
- [ ] Quality gates prevent deployment of poor-quality code
- [ ] Secrets are properly managed and not exposed
- [ ] Rollback procedures are tested and documented
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting are configured
- [ ] Compliance requirements are validated
- [ ] Performance benchmarks are met
- [ ] Environment parity is maintained
- [ ] Approval processes are properly configured
- [ ] Audit trails are comprehensive and automated

## üîí Security Best Practices

### Pipeline Security:
- Use least privilege access principles
- Scan all dependencies for vulnerabilities
- Implement secrets rotation
- Enable audit logging for all pipeline activities
- Use signed commits and verified builds
- Implement branch protection rules
- Scan container images before deployment

### Compliance Integration:
- Automated PCI DSS validation
- SOX audit trail generation
- GDPR data handling verification
- Regulatory change tracking
- Risk assessment automation
- Incident response procedures
