## üé® Advanced Prompting Techniques

### Chain of Thought Prompting

```
Let's work through creating a secure payment system step by step:

1. First, identify the security requirements for payment processing
2. Then, design the API structure with proper validation
3. Next, implement error handling and logging
4. Finally, create comprehensive tests

For each step, explain your reasoning and consider:
- Security implications
- Performance impact
- Compliance requirements
- User experience
```

### Few-Shot Learning

```
Here are examples of well-structured user stories:

Example 1:
"As a loan officer, I want to view applicant credit scores so that I can make informed lending decisions"
Acceptance Criteria:
- Credit score displays within 2 seconds
- Shows score from all three bureaus
- Includes score date and factors

Example 2:
"As a borrower, I want to upload income documents so that I can complete my loan application"
Acceptance Criteria:
- Supports PDF and image formats
- Maximum file size 10MB
- Document verification within 24 hours

Now create similar user stories for account opening process...
```

### Iterative Refinement

```
INITIAL PROMPT: "Create a payment processing function"

REFINED PROMPT: "Create a TypeScript payment processing function that handles credit card payments using Stripe API, includes proper error handling, and logs all transactions for audit purposes"

FINAL PROMPT: "As a senior backend developer, create a production-ready TypeScript payment processing function for a fintech application that:
- Integrates with Stripe API v2023-10-16
- Validates card data using Luhn algorithm
- Implements retry logic for network failures
- Logs all operations for PCI compliance audit
- Returns structured error responses
- Includes comprehensive unit tests with 90%+ coverage
- Uses TypeScript strict mode with proper type definitions"
```

## üîç Context Engineering

### Providing Relevant Context

```
CONTEXT LAYERS:

1. BUSINESS CONTEXT:
   - Industry: Fintech lending platform
   - Scale: 100,000+ active users
   - Compliance: SOX, PCI DSS, GDPR

2. TECHNICAL CONTEXT:
   - Stack: Node.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Redis
   - Architecture: Microservices on Kubernetes
   - Current systems: Stripe for payments, Plaid for banking

3. IMMEDIATE CONTEXT:
   - Current task: Implementing loan approval workflow
   - Constraints: 5-second response time requirement
   - Integration: Must work with existing credit scoring service

Now create the implementation...
```

### File and Code Context

```
Based on the existing UserService.ts file:
[Include relevant code snippets]

And following the pattern from PaymentService.ts:
[Include architectural patterns]

Create a new LoanService.ts that maintains consistency with our existing codebase while implementing the loan application workflow.
```

## üöÄ Productivity Optimization

### Prompt Templates Library

Create reusable prompt templates for common tasks:

```json
{
  "api_endpoint": "Create a REST API endpoint for [resource] that includes validation, error handling, authentication, and comprehensive tests",
  "database_migration": "Generate a database migration script that [action] while maintaining data integrity and including rollback procedures",
  "test_suite": "Create comprehensive test suite for [feature] including unit tests, integration tests, and edge cases",
  "documentation": "Write technical documentation for [component] that includes setup, usage examples, and troubleshooting guide"
}
```

### Batch Processing

```
Generate the following components for user authentication feature:
1. TypeScript interfaces for User and AuthRequest
2. Express.js routes with validation middleware  
3. JWT token service with refresh logic
4. Database models and migrations
5. Unit tests for all components
6. Integration tests for API endpoints
7. API documentation in OpenAPI format

Ensure all components follow our established patterns and include proper error handling.
```

## üìä Quality Assurance for AI-Generated Content

### Validation Checklist

- [ ] **Functionality**: Does the code work as intended?
- [ ] **Security**: Are there any security vulnerabilities?
- [ ] **Performance**: Is the solution efficient?
- [ ] **Maintainability**: Is the code clean and well-documented?
- [ ] **Testing**: Are there adequate tests?
- [ ] **Compliance**: Does it meet regulatory requirements?

### Code Review Prompts

```
Review the following AI-generated code for:
1. Security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, authentication bypass)
2. Performance issues (N+1 queries, memory leaks, inefficient algorithms)
3. Code quality (naming conventions, error handling, documentation)
4. Compliance issues (data privacy, audit requirements, retention policies)

Provide specific suggestions for improvement with code examples.
```

## üîß Troubleshooting Common Issues

### When AI Responses Are Too Generic

```
‚ùå Generic: "Create a login system"
‚úÖ Specific: "Create a JWT-based authentication system for a fintech app that includes:
- Multi-factor authentication support
- Session management with Redis
- Password policy enforcement (12+ chars, special chars, numbers)
- Account lockout after 5 failed attempts
- Audit logging for all authentication events
- Rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks"
```

### When AI Misses Important Details

```
Add these specific requirements to your prompts:
- Error handling strategy
- Logging and monitoring
- Security considerations
- Performance requirements
- Testing approach
- Documentation needs
```

### When Output Doesn't Match Your Architecture

```
Include architectural context:
"Following our microservices architecture pattern where:
- Each service has its own database
- Services communicate via REST APIs
- All requests go through API gateway
- Authentication is handled centrally
- We use event-driven patterns for async operations

Create a notification service that fits this architecture..."
```

## üìö Continuous Improvement

### Measuring Prompt Effectiveness

Track metrics for your prompts:
- **Accuracy**: How often does the AI provide correct solutions?
- **Completeness**: Does the output include all required components?
- **Efficiency**: How much time is saved compared to manual development?
- **Quality**: Does the output meet your quality standards?

### Building Your Prompt Library

1. **Document Successful Prompts**: Save prompts that generate high-quality results
2. **Version Control**: Track prompt evolution and improvements
3. **Team Sharing**: Share effective prompts with team members
4. **Regular Updates**: Refine prompts based on experience and feedback

### Learning from Failures

```
When a prompt doesn't work:
1. Analyze what was missing or unclear
2. Identify the specific issue (context, specificity, format)
3. Refine the prompt incrementally
4. Test the improved version
5. Document lessons learned
```

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Practice**: Use these techniques in your daily development work
2. **Experiment**: Try different prompt styles and approaches
3. **Measure**: Track the effectiveness of your prompts
4. **Share**: Contribute successful prompts to the team library
5. **Iterate**: Continuously improve your prompting skills
