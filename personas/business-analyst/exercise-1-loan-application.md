- Average processing time goal: Under 24 hours
- Approval rate target: 65-70%
- Compliance: Consumer lending regulations, data privacy laws
- Integration: Credit bureaus, bank account verification, identity verification

## ðŸš€ AI-Assisted Tasks

### Task 1: Requirements Analysis with AI

**AI Prompt Template:**
```
Act as a senior business analyst for a fintech company. Analyze the following loan application system requirements:

Business Goal: Create an automated personal loan application system for loans ranging from $1,000 to $50,000 with 12-60 month terms.

Target Users: Working professionals aged 25-55
Business Objectives:
- Process applications in under 24 hours
- Achieve 65-70% approval rate
- Ensure regulatory compliance
- Provide excellent user experience

Generate a comprehensive requirements analysis including:
1. Functional requirements (detailed list)
2. Non-functional requirements (performance, security, usability)
3. Integration requirements (third-party services)
4. Compliance requirements (regulations and standards)
5. User experience requirements
6. Data requirements and privacy considerations
7. Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
8. Success metrics and KPIs

Format the output as a structured document with clear sections and bullet points.
```

**Your Task:**
1. Use the above prompt with GitHub Copilot Chat or Cursor AI
2. Review and refine the generated requirements
3. Add specific fintech considerations
4. Document the output in `requirements-analysis.md`

### Task 2: User Story Generation

**AI Prompt Template:**
```
Based on the loan application system requirements, create comprehensive user stories for the following personas:

Primary Personas:
1. Loan Applicant (first-time borrower)
2. Loan Applicant (returning customer)
3. Loan Officer (manual review cases)
4. Compliance Officer (audit and monitoring)
5. Customer Service Representative (application support)

For each persona, create user stories following this format:
"As a [persona], I want [functionality] so that [benefit]"

Include for each story:
- Acceptance criteria (Given/When/Then format)
- Priority (High/Medium/Low)
- Story points estimation (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13)
- Dependencies on other stories
- Definition of Done
- Notes about edge cases or special considerations

Focus on the complete loan application journey from initial application to funding.
```

**Your Task:**
1. Generate comprehensive user stories using AI
2. Review and prioritize the stories
3. Organize into epics and sprints
4. Document in `user-stories.md`

### Task 3: Process Flow Documentation

**AI Prompt Template:**
```
Create a detailed business process flow for the automated loan application system. The process should cover:

Main Flow:
1. Application initiation
2. Personal information collection
3. Financial information gathering
4. Document upload and verification
5. Credit check and scoring
6. Automated decision making
7. Manual review (if needed)
8. Approval/rejection notification
9. Loan agreement and e-signature
10. Fund disbursement

Include:
- Decision points and business rules
- Error handling and exception flows
- Integration touchpoints
- Compliance checkpoints
- User experience considerations
- Timeline expectations

Generate:
1. High-level process flow description
2. Detailed step-by-step process
3. PlantUML diagram code for the process flow
4. Business rules and decision criteria
5. Exception handling procedures
```

**Your Task:**
1. Generate the process flow using AI
2. Create the PlantUML diagram
3. Validate the flow with stakeholder scenarios
4. Document in `process-flow.md`

### Task 4: Risk Assessment and Compliance

**AI Prompt Template:**
```
Conduct a comprehensive risk assessment for the automated loan application system:

Risk Categories to analyze:
1. Operational risks
2. Technology risks
3. Compliance and regulatory risks
4. Financial risks
5. Reputational risks
6. Data privacy and security risks

For each risk category, provide:
- Specific risk scenarios
- Likelihood assessment (High/Medium/Low)
- Impact assessment (High/Medium/Low)
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Monitoring and control measures
- Compliance requirements

Regulatory Considerations:
- Truth in Lending Act (TILA)
- Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)
- Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA)
- GDPR/CCPA for data privacy
- Anti-money laundering (AML)
- Know Your Customer (KYC)

Generate a structured risk register with mitigation plans.
```

**Your Task:**
1. Generate comprehensive risk assessment
2. Create risk mitigation strategies
3. Map compliance requirements to features
4. Document in `risk-assessment.md`
